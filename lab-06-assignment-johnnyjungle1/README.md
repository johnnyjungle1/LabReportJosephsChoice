# Lab #6 Assignment: Independent Project

## Overview

You will choose an independent project to extend one of the exercises you
did in a previous lab (#2--#5). You will work alone or with a partner
to develop a new question that goes beyond the previous lab assignments, but
builds upon a previous exercise. 

You will submit a proposed topic by Friday, Feb. 21 to Prof. Gilligan or 
Ms. Best for approval (by email or in person at one of our office hours). 
This can just be a short paragraph describing the question you plan to 
investigate and the data or computational model you will use.

After finishing your investigation, over the next several weeks, 
You will turn in a formal lab report, prepared with 
RMarkdown and knitted successfully into a PDF file by 11:59 pm on 
Thursday March 12.

You will also present the results of your investigation in a short presentation
during the lab period on Monday March 16.

This project repository contains copies of the scripts we used in previous labs
and a blank RMarkdown file in which you can fill in your lab report.
